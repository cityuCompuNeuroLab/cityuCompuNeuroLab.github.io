<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Rosa H. M. Chan is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Electronic Engineering at City University of Hong Kong.
She received her B.Eng (1st Hon.) degree in Automation and Computer-Aided Engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2003.
Her undergraduate studies had brought her to New York University (US) to study computer animation and visual effects and Kyushu University (Japan) to research on microfluidics for astronautics applications.
She was later awarded the Croucher Scholarship and Sir Edward Youde Memorial Fellowship for Overseas Studies in 2004 to pursue her graduate studies at University of Southern California (USC).
In the summer of 2010, she was supported by Google Scholarship to participate in the Singularity University Graduate Studies Program at NASA AMES.
Dr. Chan received her Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering in 2011 at USC, where she also received her M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering.
Her research interests include computational neuroscience, neural prosthesis and brain-computer interface applications.
She was the co-recipient of the Outstanding Paper Award of IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering in 2013, for their research breakthroughs in mathematical modelling for hippocampal cognitive prosthesis and memory facilitation.
Dr. Chan was the Chair of the Hong Kong-Macau Joint Chapter of IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) in 2014 and is elected to the IEEE EMBS AdCom as Asia Pacific Representative (2018-2020).</p>
