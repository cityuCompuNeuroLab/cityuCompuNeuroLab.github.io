Chan is a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at City University of Hong Kong, where she previously served as Associate Head (Research and Graduate Programmes) in 2023. Her research interests include computational neuroscience, neural prosthesis, and human-computer interaction. She received a B. Eng. (1st Hon.) degree in Automation and Computer-Aided Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2003.  She was later awarded the Croucher Scholarship and Sir Edward Youde Memorial Fellowship for Overseas Studies in 2004. Dr. Chan received her Ph. D. degree in Biomedical Engineering in 2011 from the University of Southern California, where she also earned her M. S. degrees in Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Aerospace Engineering.  
</p>
<p>She was the co-recipient of the Outstanding Paper Award of IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering in 2013, for research breakthroughs in mathematical modeling for cognitive prosthesis. She also shared the Gold Medal in Inventions Geneva Evaluation Days (IGED), a virtual edition of the International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva, in 2021, for a youth sports education and management SaaS platform based on AIoT.   Alongside her research, Dr. Chan was also recognized for her teaching with the College of Engineering Outstanding Teaching Award in 2024.</p>
