== Biography
Dr. Rosa H. M. Chan is currently an Associate Professor and Associate Head (Research and Graduate Programmes) in the Department of Electrical Engineering at City University of Hong Kong.  Her research interests include computational neuroscience, neural prosthesis, and human-computer interaction. She received a B. Eng. (1st Hon.) degree in Automation and Computer-Aided Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2003.  She was later awarded the Croucher Scholarship and Sir Edward Youde Memorial Fellowship for Overseas Studies in 2004. She received her Ph. D. degree in Biomedical Engineering in 2011 from the University of Southern California, where she also earned her M. S. degrees in Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Aerospace Engineering.  She was the co-recipient of the Outstanding Paper Award of IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering in 2013, for their research breakthroughs in mathematical modeling for cognitive prosthesis. She was also the co-recipient of Gold Medal in Inventions Geneva Evaluation Days (IGED), a virtual edition of the International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva, in 2021, for a youth sports education and management SaaS platform based on AIoT.   Dr. Chan is VP-Elect (Finance) of IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS). She was the Chair of the Hong Kong-Macau Joint Chapter of IEEE EMBS in 2014,  and elected to the IEEE EMBS Administrative Committee (AdCom) as Asia Pacific Representative (2018-2022). Currently, she is an editorial board member of the Journal of Neural Engineering and an area editor (neural signal processing and imaging) of Encyclopedia Brain (IEEE-Wiley).
